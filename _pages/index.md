Nirmal Nair is a Ph.D. candidate in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). His research interests lie in the intersection of **computational fluid dynamics**, **machine learning** and **high-performance computing** where he aims to significantly reduce the cost of simulating high-fidelity fluid flows eventually leading to faster aerodynamic design, optimization and control.

Currently he is developing algorithms and models for real-time state estimation using limited sensor data, high-performance computing for simulating and studying complex fluid-structure interaction in an immersed boundary framework and efficient reduced-order modeling of advection dominated flows.
