Nirmal Nair is a Ph.D. candidate in Aerospace Engineering under [Prof. Andres Goza](https://aerospace.illinois.edu/directory/profile/agoza) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). Previously, he completed his Master's thesis under [Dr. Maciej Balajewicz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maciejbalajewicz) at the same department and university. Nirmal's interests lie in the intersection of **computational fluid dynamics**, **machine learning** and **high-performance computing** where he aims to significantly reduce the cost of high-fidelity physics-based simulations eventually leading to faster design, optimization and control.
